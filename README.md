# MINNIE
M(?) ab Initio Neural Network Interatomic Engine

MINNIE is a C++/Python software and library that can be used to train an atomic Neural Network 
to reproduce ab-inito total energy and force calculations.

The focus of this library is the easy-to-use and extendibility through python scripting. 
The aim of the project is to make it interfaced with tools like ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment),
to provide a fast and reliable calculator for energy, forces and stress tensors of condensed matter system as well as big organic molecules 

MINNIE is a free software, and comes as it is, without any warranty.

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VERSION, DO NOT USE IT IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
